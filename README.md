Project Motivation:

The why?: Are you about to put your London property up for rent on Airbnb? Maybe you are wondering when during the year is best? What are the most important features of your house to highlight and how much should you charge for your property?

In order to address the above situation, I took a look at the Airbnb London dataset and specifically answered the following 3 questions:
1. When during the year is it most likely to get your Airbnb property rented out and which months/days can you charge more
2. How much can you charge for your property?
3. What features of your house should you highlight in order to maximize the rental price you can charge?


Requirements:

The library was run on a standard session of Googles "Colab" with the following libraries imported:
- Nympy
- Pandas
- Scipy (particularly stats)
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn


Files in the repository:

- README.md: description of the project
- London_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb: the Colab (jupiter) notebook containing the analysis of the project
